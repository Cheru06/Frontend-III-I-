# Cheru.tech - Company Website (Project)

This is a personal project where I designed and developed a mock company website for **Cheru.tech**, a fictional IT solutions company. The goal was to practice building a modern, responsive website and simulate a real-world company landing page.

## 🌐 About the Project

Cheru.tech is imagined as an IT company offering services like software development, cloud infrastructure, data analytics, and emerging tech solutions. The site includes:

- Homepage with company intro
- Services section
- About Us
- Contact form
- Responsive layout

> **Note:** This is not an official website for a real company. It's a self-initiated project for learning and portfolio purposes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- (Optional) React or any framework used  
- Responsive design using Flexbox / Grid  
- (Optional) Hosted on Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages
