        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I am someone who finds inspiration in both the vastness of the universe and the fine details of technology. 
          Ever since I encountered the works of <span class="highlight">Carl Sagan</span>, 
          <span class="highlight">Neil deGrasse Tyson</span>, <span class="highlight">Brian Cox</span>, and 
          <span class="highlight">Michio Kaku</span>, I have been fascinated by the mysteries of space and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concepts of <span class="highlight">quantum entanglement</span>, 
          <span class="highlight">string theory</span>, and 
          <span class="highlight">Einsteinâ€™s relativity</span> drive me to imagine a unified framework of physics 
          that explains everything from <span class="highlight">black holes</span> to <span class="highlight">wormholes</span>. 
          Beyond science, I admire inventors like <span class="highlight">Nikola Tesla</span>, whose creations 
          continue to inspire technological revolutions today.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I have a deep interest in practical engineering. I enjoy experimenting with robotics, 
          electronics, and computing, combining theory with hands-on application. To me, science and engineering 
          are not separateâ€”they are two sides of the same journey, one that moves us closer to understanding the 
          universe while also creating innovations that change our daily lives.
